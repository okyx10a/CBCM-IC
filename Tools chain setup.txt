Here's the git hub link of the CBCM project: https://github.com/okyx10a/CBCM-IC.git
Custom PCB design files will be found in directory: /Hardware/CBCM PCB
Design tool :Altium Designer

For programming the microcontroller:
Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
Guide on how to set up Arduino Due: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoDue
Due's microcontroller datasheet:SAM3X datasheet
Pin mapping for the microcontroller to board layout:Pin mapping

For the running the interface program:
Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
To install various python packages you will need: pip it's basically a package manager
Additional python packages: 
pyserial (for USB communication)
numpy, scipy, matplot (they make python work like Matlab)
pyqt5 (For GUI I'm currently working on)

Optional tools:
To unlock the full potential of the microcontroller I would recommend Atmel Studio together with MicrochipÂ® Advanced Software Framework. They are way more professional however totally optional. 
For debugging serial port: RealTerm 
For version control with GitHub: Sourcetree or Github desktop
