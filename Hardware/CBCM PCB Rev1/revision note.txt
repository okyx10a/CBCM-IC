PCB:

1-      We delete the redundant parts and only keep the following:

-          Chip Socket

-          Arduino Due Board

-          Voltage Regulators

 

2-      We make the following changes:

-          Add decoupling capacitor between Vdd and GND of input power jack, 3 capacitors in parallel, 10uF, 47uF, 100uF.

-          Add decoupling capacitors as close as possible to the chip between AVin and DVin and GND 0.1uF

-          Connect the Analog GND and digital GND and the GND of MCU using the large ground plate

-          Use voltage regulators of a fixed output (current version is an adjustable output that requires using precision capacitors and resistors)

-          Fix the wiring problem between the GND and Vref of the right side

-          Add one analog MUX (2 to 1) to measure both sides data 

-          //Leave only one reference voltage and add a 100uf decoupling cap to it

-          New regulators will still need 3 decoulping capacitors 0.1uF, 1uF, 10uF in parallel

-          For 10uF and 47uF capacitors the most commom land size will be 4.3mm by 4.3mm as for the 100uF ones the most common size will be 6.6mm by 6.6mm

-          Keep 2mm margin from the edge
